The compressed file provided contains the complete dataset from the first experiment described in the manuscript,
enabling readers to faithfully reproduce the experimental program. 
Each instance file is in .xls format and corresponds to a specific scenario 
comprising 100 customers, 21 charging stations, and five depots.
Regarding client delivery and pickup volumes, the pickup volume at RLSSs is randomly generated as an integer
within the range of 5 to 40 using the randi function.
The delivery volumes for urban customers remain consistent with the data from the Solomon test set.
Whether an urban customer delivers agricultural or industrial products is predetermined through prior random assignment.
